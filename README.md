# Lazy Loading Image Gallery

This is an Image Gallery App that loads pictures from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). It uses `lazy loading` to make the app faster and more responsive, and the `Intersection Observation API` to optimize the loading process and is built using `Vite`.
